# Research Phase

Explore the codebase to understand context for a task.

## Input
Research topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Request
Clarify what information is needed.

### Step 2: Explore Codebase
Search for:
- Related existing code
- Patterns and conventions
- Test examples
- Documentation
- Dependencies

### Step 3: Document Findings

```markdown
## Research: [topic]

### Existing Implementation
[What already exists related to this]

### Patterns Used
[Conventions and patterns in the codebase]

### Key Files
- `path/to/file.ts` - [relevance]
- `path/to/other.ts` - [relevance]

### Dependencies
[External libraries or internal modules involved]

### Considerations
[Things to be aware of, edge cases, constraints]

### Recommendations
[Suggested approach based on findings]
```

### Step 4: Present Summary
Give a concise summary of findings and ask if more research is needed.
